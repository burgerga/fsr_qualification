# FSR qualification
This repository supports the GoFAIR Foundation qualification process for FAIR Supporting Resources (FSRs) and FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs). Unqualified nanopub resources are represented by open issues.

The process can be undertaken by qualified FIP (or 3PFF) Facilitators and the check/review process for each FSR requires two facilitators to fulfil the roles of editor and reviewer respectively.

## Contributing

See the guide on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) that explains the functional qualification process in conjunction with the git/GitHub workflow.
